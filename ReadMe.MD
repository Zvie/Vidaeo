Created in Visual Studio 2017 Professional Edition

This is a test digital video rentals app I'd created using ASP.MVC.  I've added in some fun libraries
Glimpse for performance testing 
Elmah for Error Logging
Twitter Type ahead for auto completion
DataTables to make the tables more aesthetically pleasing. Plus auto pagination and sorting
BootBox, because aesthetics
Toastr - toastr notifications

There is also validation for the forms, as well as user roles and page restrictions. 

////// REMINDER

Be sure to toggle on the show all files in the solution explorer to view the database and its
tables.

API - RESTful convention
Application also uses Jquery and Ajax

// Since this isn't commercial ready I didn't bother with the API call for the new customers and Movies
// That said the New Rentals is set up through API calls instead of just through the controller

/// NOTE 

Next Web Application will be using the JavaScript framework of Vue.js for front end and Axios for api consumption with Vue.
Though I might just continue on with this app, and branch off with different libraries such as 
Angular, React, and Vue
